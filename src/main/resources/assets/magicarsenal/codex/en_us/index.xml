		Tabs and spaces before and after a newline are folded, so text can be wrapped and indented to a convenient

		to be entirely rewritten, this can be done arbitrarily.
		
		This also means that if a modpack minetweaks this mod in a drastic way, a resource pack can amend the book,
		so that it can continue to be an effective guide to the mod and perhaps more.
		
		Numeric page IDs are *ignored*! These are just to help the author keep track of what's supposed to go where in

			After extensive testing, I have more questions than answers about the Portal-Seared Tomes. They were once
			very well-made books, bound in sturdy leather and clad in a silvery metal, neither of which I can quite
			identify. There are traces of a Protection enchant at higher levels than I've ever thought possible, but
			whatever happened to these books shattered those enchantments like glass.
		</left>
		<right>
			However, when comparing the books to each other, some things clear up: They are all copies of the §osame§r
			tome. The foreward seems to be the most legible part, and if it's to be believed, the Tomes come from
			§oanother universe§r. As it isn't named in the book, I will simply call it Elsewhere.
		</right>
	</page>
	<page id="1">

			The tome that these copies are made of must be filled with magical spells and contrivances far beyond
			anything I've studied in this world. Every new scrap I find has another crazy spell or machine on it! If I
			could reconstruct even a small fraction of these devices, I'd be one of the most powerful wizards of my age.

		<background ref="magicarsenal:textures/guis/codex/feature.poison.png"/>
		<right>
			The pages detailing most of the contraptions are frequently splattered with poison. §oStrong§r poison. It's
			definitely important to the magic. I have a feeling I can't just brew up a spider eye though. I've heard of
			plants called §lWolfsbane§r and §lNightshade§r, and if I could just track down roots for them, I could
			cultivate these plants and have better poison for my arrows, too.
		</right>
	</page>
	<page id="2">
		<left>
			Nightshade is potent beyond my wildest imaginings. It's even more toxic to reptiles than to humans, and
			undead seem to be able to feed off its corruption, unlike spider venoms. Wolfsbane is slightly less potent,
			but my pets seem unusually wary of the substance, giving it a wide berth in the lab. I don't have the heart
			to test it, but I suspect the name "Wolfsbane" isn't random.

		<item id="magicarsenal:runestone.1" data="0"/> <!-- Uncarved Runestone-->

			As far as I can decipher, the tomes seem to indicate that poisons can be used to ward stone. I tried the
			stronger venom first, figuring it'd make a stronger ward. While it has definitely transformed the stone, and
			I can etch symbols from the books into it, there doesn't seem to be anything magical about it at all.
			Perhaps it'll make a good decoration.
		</right>
	</page>
	<page id="3">
		<left>
			In my poison research, it's becoming clear that Nightshade doesn't just paralyze the nerves, but also
			carries within it the unmalleable magical toxin that the tomes are calling "Chaos". According to the texts,
			the spaces between worlds are vast, dark oceans of this energy, and that nothing living has ever crossed the
			divide. I don't plan on trying either.
		</left>
		<item id="magicarsenal:stele.uncarved"/>
		<right>
			The reaction to Wolfsbane was instantly, completely different. While toxic to living things, stone becomes
			warded so well that I can't even carve magical symbols into it. This §lUncarved Stele§r hums with energy
			flowing through it. I can only guess that I need to carve the stone before I ward it, but that doesn't seem
			to be the whole picture.

			The breakthrough I needed came from the book. Deciphering it has become strangely easier as I've added more
			pages to my codex. Every single one of these runes has an affinity! Rune stele are sympathetic magic, and so
			their making requires a physical "link" to the concept that the symbol represents. It seems that my research
			will be at a standstill unless I can learn about the affinities of some of these runes.

			This rune seems to be a good place to start. Its nature seems deeply tied to wisdom and light, so if I can
			affix it properly, it should be of great use to me in unraveling the secrets of magic. In order to link the
			concept to the material world, I'll use a torch and an enchanted book.

			It's supposed to react with bookcases and torches it "sees".

			After staring at the inert Kenaz rune, questioning my direction in life, I realized there's simply nowhere
			for the energy to §ogo§r. I've become so familiar with the tomes at this point I very quickly found a design
			for an altar that looks perfect for gathering "Radiant Energy". This §lRunic Altar§r will probably become
			central to my endeavor.
		</left>
		<item id="magicarsenal:altar"/>
		<background ref="magicarsenal:textures/guis/codex/feature.altar.png"/>
		<right>
			The tomes plead for caution here: "Don't put anything in front of a Stele you don't want to lose." Whatever
			that means.
		</right>
	</page>
	<page id="7">
		<left>
			That did it! As soon as the altar and the stele got within 16 meters of each other, I started seing what can
			only be described as magical energy moving from the stele to the altar. The tomes describe a "Luminiferous
			Aether" with this radiant energy perpetually moving through it and pushing Chaos away. The altar is like a
			delta near the end of a river of Radiance.
		</left>
		<right>
			And just like flowing water can turn a wheel or erode a stone, moving Radiance can transmute matter, usually
			in ways that deepen its affinity with magic. Like all transmutation, this relies on the principle of
			equivalent exchange, so if the result contains properties the original does not have, the stele will balance
			the equation somehow. The manner in which they do so clearly depends on their affinity.
		</right>
	</page>
	<page id="8">
		<left>
			I hit a snag when I tried to scale up my system. Two of the same rune wouldn't connect, no matter how I
			arranged them. It looked random which stele got to contribute. It looks like I'll need to diversify my runes
			in order to reach higher radiance levels. In the meantime, if our world is anything like Elsewhere, living
			things should have energy moving through them too.
		</left>
		<background ref="magicarsenal:textures/guis/codex/feature.focuscore.png"/>
		<right>
			The book describes a more portable device to channel this energy into very temporary supernatural phenomena.
			To work well, it needs to be carved out of a material which is already strongly-attuned to magic. Once the
			forces are in motion, some kind of resonating crystal is needed to manage the effect's duration and, if it's
			shaped just right, prevent energy from being wasted in a big puff of psychic pollution.
		</right>

		<left>
			Strangely, in our sister land of Elsewhere, they have tales of a Prometheus-like benefactor bringing them
			§oFrost§r, not fire. The bones of the universe, the tomes say, are bitter cold and frozen-through,
			unmoveable and eternal. The foundations of magic are thus manifestations of cold. And they, in turn, have
			shouted it across the void so that the magic doesn't die. I won't disappoint them.
		</left>
		<background ref="magicarsenal:textures/guis/codex/feature.frostshards.png"/>
		<right>
			I'm putting it all together. If I combine these objects at the altar, and there's enough radiance, I can
			make a spell focus that can manifest the cold and direct it in an attack. It doesn't seem like it ever
			matters what order they're in, as long as it's the right combination.
